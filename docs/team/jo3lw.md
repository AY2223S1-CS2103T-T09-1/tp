### Project: JeeqTracQer

JeeqTracQer is a desktop application that drives the backend of small business owners, helping them to keep track of transactions and remarks for clients they interact with.
It is optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI), while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.
