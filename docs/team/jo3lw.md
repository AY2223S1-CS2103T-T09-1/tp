### Project: JeeqTracQer

JeeqTracQer is a desktop application that drives the backend of small business owners, helping them to keep track of transactions and remarks for clients they interact with.
It is optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI), while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added ability to `sort` specific clients
    * What it does: This feature displays the sorted transactions of a specified client based on date of transaction.
    * Justification: This feature is essential for users to view what transactions they have made recently instead of having to search through a long list of transactions.

* **New Feature**: Added `Date` feature to transactions
    * What it does: This feature allows users to tag valid dates to translations.
    * Justification: This feature is essential for users to know which transaction was made on which date.

* **New Feature**: Added `buy` and `sell` parsers
    * This feature converts the user input for buy/sell command to be create a corresponding buy/sell command.
    * Justification: This feature is essential for users to input transactions so that our application can keep track of them.
