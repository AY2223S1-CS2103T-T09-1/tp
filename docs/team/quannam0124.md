### Project: JeeqTracker

JeeqTracker is a desktop app that allows small business owners to keep track of their business partners as well
as their transactions.

JeeqTracker is designed to be used with CLI (Command Line Interface), and it has GUI created using JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Net Transaction**:
  * This feature displays the net amount transacted with all clients displayed in the left client list panel in JeeqTracker
  * It allows users to see how much they have transacted with all clients displayed on the left
* **Edit Client/Transaction/Remark**:
  * This feature allows users edit the details of an existing client/transaction/remark in the address book.
  * This helps users to change details of the contact list without deleting and adding again.
  * I implemented 3 separate commands for client, transaction, and remark respectively. These commands inherit from an abstract EditCommand class
* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=quannam0124&breakdown=true&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2022-09-16&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other')
