### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/NewUiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts (`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ClientListPanel`, `TransactionListPanel`, `RemarkListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `HelpWindow`, `NetTransactionBox`). All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `ClientListPanel`, `TransactionListPanel`, `RemarkListPanel` contains `ClientCard`, `TransactionCard`, `RemarkCard` respectively. These **panels** can hold any number of their respective **card**. These cards also inherit from the abstract `UiPart`, and represents the GUI of a single Client, Transaction, or Panel.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Client`, `Transaction`, and `Remark` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `JeeqTrackerParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a client).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `JeeqTrackerParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `JeeqTrackerParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram3.png"/>


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Client` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueClientList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Client` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Client>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **How Transaction and Remark are modelled:** 
The diagrams below show the Transaction and Remark Model and how they are stored in Client. <br>

**`Transaction` Class <br>**
Each `Client` Class has a `TransactionLog` which stores all transactions of the client in a List. The `Transaction` object contains the `Goods` transacted,
`Price` of the goods, `Quantity` of goods and `Date` of the transaction. <br>
<img src="images/TransactionModelClassDiagram2.png" width="350"/>


**`Remark` Class <br>**
Each `Client` Class has a `UniqueRemarkList` which stores `Remark` object that do not 
have the same `Text` (case-insensitive). The `Remark` object contains the 
`Text` which represents the remark's text. <br>
<img src="images/RemarkModelClassDiagram.png" width="350"/>
</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageDiagram.png" width="700" />

The `Storage` component,

* can save both jeeqtracker data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `JeeqTrackerStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.jeeqtracker.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Proposed\] Data archiving

_{Explain here how the data archiving feature will be implemented}_

### Filter feature for transactions

#### Implementation

The filter transaction mechanism is facilitated by `FilterTransCommand` which extends from `Command` and `FilterTransCmdParser` which extends from `Parser`. To invoke the filter command, `FilterTransCmdParser` will parse the arguments from the user input via `FilterTransCmdParser#parse()` and returns the filter command if the arguments are valid.

`FilterTransCommand` calls the `FilterTransCommand#execute()` operation which executes the command and returns the result message in a `CommandResult` object.

The operation is exposed in the `Logic` interface as `Logic#execute()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the filter mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application. The `UiManager` will call on the `MainWindow` to invoke the UI which displays all the clients.

Step 2. The user executes `filter buy` command to filter all the buy transactions from all the clients. This is done by calling the
`Client#getBuyTransactionList()` which returns an unmodifiable view of the buy transaction list.


Step 3. The `CommandResult` of `FilterTransCommand` will call `MainWindow#handleFilterTransaction()`,
to display only the filtered buy transactions from the `Client#getBuyTransactionList()` while the client panel list will display all the clients.

The following sequence diagram shows how the filter operation works:

![FilterTransSequenceDiagram](images/FilterTransSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `FilterTransCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the filter command:

<img src="images/FilterTransCmdActivityDiagram2.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How filter transaction executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Filter all the transactions made by all the clients.
    * Pros: Easy to implement and allow the user to see all the buy or sell transactions at one glance.
    * Cons: May have performance issues due to searching through all transactions of each client. Unable distinguish which transaction belong to which client.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual filter transaction for each client.
    * Pros: Performs faster as the command only filters through one client transactions. Also, user would be able to know which client the filtered transactions are from.
    * Cons: User would have to manually select each client and filter the transactions.

### \[Proposed\] Buy feature for transactions

The proposed sort mechanism is facilitated by `BuyCommand`. It extends `Command` and `BuyCommandParser` which extends from `Parser`.
To invoke the buy command, `BuyCommandParser` will parse the arguments from the user input via `BuyCommandParser#parse()` and returns the buy command
if the arguments are valid.

`BuyCommand` implements the `BuyCommandParser#execute()` operation which executes the command and returns the result message in a 
`CommandResult` object.

The operation is exposed in the `logic` interface as `Logic#execute()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the buy transaction mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application. The `UiManager` will call on the `MainWindow` to invoke the UI which displays the clients.

![BuyState0](images/BuyState0-initial_state.png)

Step 2. The user executes `buy 1 q/10 g/Apple p/0.5 d/17/05/2000` command to add a buy transaction of 10 apples at $0.50 each on the 17/05/2000 to the
client at index 1.

Step 3. The `Execute` of `BuyCommand` will call `Model#getFilteredClientList()` to get the list of clients. `List<Client>#get()` is called to
get the client at the index to copy. The `BuyTransaction` is then added to the copied client by calling `Client#addTransaction(Transaction)`.
The copied client is replaced with the client at the index by calling `Model#setClient(Client, Client)`.

The following sequence diagrams shows how the buy operation works:

![BuyCommandSequenceDiagram](images/BuyCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `BuyCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

 </div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the buy command:

<img src="images/BuyCommandActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How buy transaction executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add buy transaction by into each client.
    * Pros: Easy to implement and allow the user to see all the buy transactions for each client via view command.
    * Cons: Users cannot see all buy transaction of every client at one time.
* **Alternative 2:** Add buy transaction to JeeqTracker instead of per client.
    * Pros: Easy to see every past buy transaction with all the clients.
    * Cons: Users may be overwhelmed if there are too many transactions. Also cannot distintively see which buy transaction belongs to which client.

_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### \[Proposed\] Editing feature for transactions
#### Implementation
The edit transaction mechanism is facilitated by EditTransactionCommand which extends from `EditCommand` (which extends from `Command`) and
`EditCommandParser` which extends from `Parser`. To invoke the edit command, `EditCommandParser` will parse the arguments from user input with
`EditCommandParser#parse()` and returns the edit command if the arguments are valid.

`EditTransactionCommand` implements the `EditTransactionCommand#execute()` operation which executes the command and returns the result
message in a `CommandResult` object.

The operation is exposed in the `Logic` interface as `Logic#execute()`.

Give below is the usage scenario and how the edit mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application. The `UiManager` will call on the `MainWindow` to invoke the UI which displays the clients.

Step 2. The user executes `view 1` command to focus on the client at index 1 and see the client's list of transactions.

Step 3. The user executes `edit 2 m/transaction q/10` command to edit the information of transaction at index 2 in the focused client's transaction list.
This is done by accessing the `TransactionLog` of the focused client, and executing `TransactionLog#setTransaction(index, editedTransaction)`

The following sequence diagram shows how the edit operation works in Logic Manager:

![EditTransactionSequenceDiagram](images/EditTransactionSequenceDiagram.png)

_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_

### Delete Client/Transaction/Remark feature

#### Current Implementation

The deletion mechanism for `clients`, `transactions`, and `remarks` is facilitated by a `DeleteCommandParser` and `DeleteCommand`.

The following class diagram shows the parent-child relation of `DeleteClientCommand`, `DeleteTransactionCommand`, `DeleteRemarkCommand` relative to the `DeleteCommand`. The concrete classes consists of the logic to delete an item stated by the name of their command.

![DeleteCommandClassDiagram](images/DeleteCommandClassDiagram.png)

The `DeleteCommandParser` will take in the `userInput`, parse it, and return the correct concrete command type that is either `DeleteClientCommand`, `DeleteTransactionCommand`, or `DeleteRemarkCommand` which will be executed to achieve the deletion functionality.

This process of deleting the first client in the list is depicted by the following sequence diagram (for user input `delete 1 m/client`):

![DeleteSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `FilterTransCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The process for deleting `transaction` and `remark` is almost the same as the process stated above, with just the following changes:
- For delete transaction:
    - `userInput` is changed to `delete 1 m/transaction`
    - `parse("1 m/transaction")` returns `d`, which is a `DeleteTransactionCommand`
    - `deleteClient(1)` is changed to `deleteTransaction(1)`
- For delete remark:
    - `userInput` is changed to `delete 1 m/remark`
    - `parse("1 m/remark")` returns `d`, which is a `DeleteRemarkCommand`
    - `deleteClient(1)` is changed to `deleteRemark(1)`

#### Design Considerations:

**Aspect: How delete executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Delete either Client/Transaction/Remark specified by `mode (m) flag` selected by `index`
    * Pros: Easy to implement and lesser commands overall since flag is used to specify each command.
    * Cons: May be more clunky to use as users have to type in a longer command.

* **Alternative 2:** Create separate individual commands to Delete Client/Transaction/Remark, e.g. `deleteClient 1`, `deleteTransaction 1`, `deleteRemark 1`.
    * Pros: More intuitive to use, shorter command to type.
    * Cons: Adds more valid commands that the user can use, which may not be very user-friendly since they have to remember more commands. Also, there will be much more classes and code.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

This product is for **home-based business owners / reseller** who need help in keeping track of clients' contacts,
transaction records, and remarks about the client.

It is particularly meant for people with these characteristics:

* needs to get things done extremely fast
* prefer desktop applications over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using Command Line Interface (CLI) applications


**Value proposition**:

With JeeqTracker, users can analyze and understand the demands of each client and provide a more personalized service
that will meet the needs of the users' clients, increasing customer engagement. Furthermore, users can keep track of
clients, transactions and remarks of a client much faster than traditional applications.

The **use case diagram** below showcases the tasks that the user can perform in JeeqTracker

![Use Case Diagram](images/UseCaseDiagram.png)

Users are able to perform several tasks within the application that is broken down into **Client tasks**, **Transaction tasks**, and **Remark tasks**. For a more detailed interaction between user and the system, read the use case descriptions below.

**Use case: UC01 - Delete a client**

**MSS**

1.  User requests to list all clients
2.  JeeqTracker shows a list of clients
3.  User requests to delete a specific client in the list
4.  JeeqTracker deletes the client

    Use case ends.

**Extensions**

* 2a. The list is empty.

  Use case ends.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1.  Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `11`.
2.  Should be able to hold up to 1000 clients, transactions, and remarks without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3.  A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
4.  The User Interface should be fully rendered within 2 seconds of launching the application.
5.  The system should be usable by a business owner who has basic knowledge of how to use a computer.
6.  The user is not required to handle the saving of clients, transactions and remarks.
7.  JeeqTracker is offered as a free tool.
8.  The source code should be open source.
